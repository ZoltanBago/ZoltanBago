<p><b>Duke Dyson</b> is my writing pen name. My name is Zoltan Bago and I am Hungarian. In 2023, I published my first book in English through <i>Lulu.com</i>. My book is currently only available as an e-book(e-pub). As a writer, I would like to publish in the fields of paranormal, fantasy, science fiction and adventure novels. In terms of scope, I think in short stories and novels. My writings fall into the category of entertainment literature and philosophy.</p>

<p> I am a writer, but I am also interested in programming. I learn <b>Python</b> with Jupyter Notebook and Visual Studio Code. First of all, I want to learn the Python programming language as much as possible. I am constantly training myself as a freelance programmer.</p>
